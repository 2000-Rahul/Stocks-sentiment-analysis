       "  'The Federal Reserve is set to conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivering his typical post-meeting afternoon conference. But with recent banking failures roiling financial markets, will Powell stay the course and pull the trigger on another hike? U.S. stocks rose sharply during Tuesday’s session, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reassured markets that backstop measures are in place to contain any contagion resulting from recent bank failures. The Nasdaq (+1.58%) resumed its streak of outperformance, as tech stocks attempt to break out of a recent range. The S&P (+1.3%) and Dow (+0.98%) also posted considerable gains, with both indexes moving back above their respective 200-day moving averages as a result. Positive seasonality (along with lower volatility) is helping boost stocks in the latter half of March. Fed Hike Odds The major indices were slightly lower in early trading Wednesday morning ahead of the Fed rate hike decision. Markets are now pricing in a roughly 88% probability of another 25-bps hike, which would lift the Fed’s key interest rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%: Image Source: CME Group Wall Street isn’t entirely ruling out a Fed pause, but concerns are rampant over an early hiatus given that inflation still remains high. Market participants will be keenly focused on Powell’s commentary during the press conference. Failures across the financial sector including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature bank have roiled global markets. But stocks have rebounded after the Fed guaranteed all uninsured deposits. Further actions to stabilize a worrisome banking sector also helped propel markets in recent days, including a deal involving the UBS purchase of troubled Credit Suisse. Markets are searching for a positive catalyst to help fuel another leg higher. Stocks are typically volatile on the day of a rate-hike decision, so there is potential for a drastic move if the Fed decides to pause.

       "  \"By Liz Moyer Investing.com -- Stocks rallied on Monday after the weekend's rescue of Credit Suisse Group (NYSE:CS) by UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) with the backing of Swiss regulators, a move that aimed to restore confidence in the financial markets. Investors are turning their attention to this week's Federal Reserve meeting and trying to figure out how influential the banking turmoil of recent weeks will be in the policymakers' decision on interest rates. Most see the Fed raising rates by a dovish quarter of a percentage point, while about a quarter of futures traders see no move at all. Investors are also worried that the Fed's moves could jolt the economy into a recession later this year. The dot-plot forecasts of the Fed's voting members will come out on Wednesday alongside the decision on rates, and investors will be studying the chart for clues about how much the Fed's thinking has changed since the last dot-plot chart. This week also brings more data on the labor market in the form of the initial jobless claims report for the prior week. Job trends have remained strong even though there is evidence price growth is slowing. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 1. Existing home sales Existing home sales for February is due out at 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT). Analysts are expecting the annual number to be 4.17 million, up slightly from the prior month, but the month-to-month increase to be 4% compared with the prior drop of 0.7%. 2.

       "  'By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Wednesday after sharply cutting intraday gains as Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell dismissed market bets on a rate cut following the central bank’s widely expected quarter-point rate hike. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.6% or 530 points.The Nasdaq fell 1.6%, and the S&P 500 fell 1.66%. The Federal Reserve lifted rates by 0.25% and signaled at least one more hike this year, but Fed chair Jerome Powell was quick to dismiss any rate cuts this year. “FOMC participants don\\'t see rate cuts this year, it is not our baseline expectations,\" Powell said at the press conference that followed the monetary policy decision and updated projections. Ahead of Powell’s comments, market participants were forecasting rate cuts later this year. Still, some on Wall Street suggest the tightening in credit conditions - following the wobble in the banking system - will serve the same role as monetary policy tightening and play a bigger role in the Fed\\'s future monetary policy decision. Bank of America, citing tighter lending standards, said it now only expects one more 25 basis points rate hike to lift rates to a terminal range of 5.0 to 5.25%, down 25bp from its prior target terminal range. Banks were back in the firing line, paced by a decline in First Republic Bank as investors were forced to rethink rate cuts that some believed were needed to help restore confidence in the banking system. First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) fell almost 16%, Comerica (NYSE:CMA) fell 8.5% and Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) fell almost 8%. As Treasury yields moved off session lows, rate-sensitive sectors of the market including tech lost momentum. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the day below session highs. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), however, bucked the trend lower, racking up a 35% gain on the day after delivering a surprise fourth-quarter profit. Some on Wall Street, however, flagged low margin growth as a concern as cost cuts played a large role in helping the company return to profit. \"The company',\n",

The KBW Regional Banking Index surged by 4.8% for its biggest gain since January 2021, boosted by a broad rally across the sector. First Republic extended its rally to a session high, gaining as much as 60%, following a Reuters report that the lender is looking at how it could downsize if attempts to raise new capital fail. Shares had earlier climbed on optimism over a new plan under discussion to aid First Republic. Under the plan, some or all of the $30 billion in deposits that a group of US banks injected would be converted into a capital infusion. A potential conversion “could add much needed stability and is another vote of confidence for the embroiled lender,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan wrote. The rally is part of a broader recovery in the banking sector across Europe and the US, as contagion concerns ease following UBS Group AG’s rescue deal for Swiss lender Credit Suisse Group AG. Investor confidence in First Republic had waned after the lender was downgraded again Sunday by S&P Global Inc., days after the ratings firm cut the lender to junk. First Republic’s share price plunged over the past two weeks as depositors pulled back money after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank dented sentiment.

       "  'Sangeet Chowfla, the former CEO of the Graduate Management Admissions Council, reflects on the business of business education Graduate Management Education (GME) seems to be entering its third cycle and this transition, like most cyclical transitions, creates changes in supply and demand with attendant winners and losers. The first phase, Wharton, Tuck, and Harvard in the early 1900s (or ESCP a century earlier if you want to go that so far), were largely national constructs. They sought to provide a holistic education in business to the sons (women were not even admitted into HBS till the mid-1950s) of the nation’s elites. There was little diversity and limited international participation till well into the post war period. GME was largely a western product for the western world. Both demand (students) and supply (business schools of quality) were in the West. The second phase started in the ’60s and ’70s, accelerated in the 90s and took off early this century. India’s balance of payments crisis (1991) and Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in China (1992) started opening two dormant economies with enormous populations. China’s accession to the WTO (2001) contributed to a new era of globalization. The resulting economic growth in India and China, with spillover effects into other developing economies, created large middle classes with a hunger for education and the development of the next generation. Demand for education, primarily in business and engineering,\\xa0 surged faster than capacity at domestic educational establishments of quality. Two other factors contributed. One was the globalization of business and the demand within corporations for truly global managers rather than western expatriates. The second was the liberalization of immigration regimes in the West, opening a pathway that could be accessed through an advanced degree.\\xa0 There were more focused effects as well. China joining the World Trade Organization created a need for staff with an understanding of western accounting standards such as GAAP and IFRS. Suddenly there was a surge of Chinese applicants to such programs in the West. Demand became global but supply was largely in the West. Many Western business schools responded by expanding capacity and programming.'],\n",
       " 'TSLA': ['It kind of makes sense that Tesla would make wireless chargers. After all, when you think of the company, you think electric vehicles and their Superchargers (at least, after you force the image of Elon Musk out of your mind). But wireless charging is a slightly different beast that requires understanding of magnetic fields and expertise in power transfer technologies. That’s where Freepower, formerly known as Aira, comes in. Founder Jake Slatnick started the company in 2017 and told Engadget that it has spent the last five and a half years developing a “much more advanced form of Qi,” the industry-wide standard for wireless charging. As a “technology supplier” according to Slatnick, Freepower doesn’t typically make products for consumers, besides the Base Station chargers it made in collaboration with Nomad Goods. When the Pro model launched in 2019, it was considered an enticing alternative to Apple’s canceled AirPower charging mat. Both promised to deliver power to up to three devices without you having to carefully align them to the charging coils. But the Base Station series is no longer supported and had compatibility issues that affected its charging speeds. In December last year, Tesla and Freepower announced the Wireless Charging Platform, and it might be a spiritual successor to the Base Station Pro. Like many of the car maker’s other products, though, it’s almost ludicrously expensive. At $300, Tesla’s offering is twice the cost of the priciest item on our roundup of the best multi-device wireless chargers. Still, diehard fans might not mind the premium, and there are some unique characteristics here that could explain the delta (although I maintain that it’s still too much to justify). For that money, you’re at least getting what feels like a sturdy, premium product. The charging platform is a dense, solid block about 220mm (8.66inches) wide that weighs 747 grams (1.64 pounds). Together with the magnetic stand that props it up at an angle, the whole thing comes in at 1.02kg (2.26 pounds), which is pretty hefty. It’s not like you’re going to be carrying this around in your backpack so it’s not',\n",
       "  'Tesla\\'s stock is overdue for a downshift into neutral after a sizzling 54% year-to-date run, warns one Wall Street analyst. Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock to hold from buy on Wednesday, citing mostly valuation relative to when bets on a cheaper new vehicle model and other technologies would bear fruit. \"We downgrade our rating to Hold now that our Buy thesis – based on misplaced fears of a price war – appears to have been accepted by the market,\" Yanoshik said. \"We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024.\" Shares of the EV maker fell more than 1% in pre-market trading. The downgrade comes on the heels of a mixed week or so of news for Tesla, as Yahoo Finance\\'s Pras Subramanian reports. Tesla\\'s overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn\\'t unveil a speculated cheaper new model. Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand — this time on the high-end Model X and Model S. Early Wednesday morning, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also announced a probe into the Model Y related to a potential steering-wheel issue. To that end, Yanoshik\\'s Tesla downgrade makes a couple of key points for investors to consider: #1: Tesla\\'s Valuation Isn\\'t Cheap Tesla\\'s stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500, as investors bake in above-market growth rates for the EV beast. But with interest rates headed higher and competition from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) rising, Tesla\\'s valuation leaves little room for error operationally, Yanoshik pointed out. \"Valuation now leaves less room for disappointment,\" Yanoshik says. #2: There Is No $25,000 Tesla Yet Investors have been clamoring for a cheaper \"Model 2\" from Tesla under the $30,000 price point. Musk has teased Tesla is working on it, but acknowledges it will take time as it tries to bring down battery and other production costs further. Yanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline',\n",
       "  'It’s all eyes on Tesla (TSLA) this week as the EV-maker will hold its Investor Day on Wednesday from its Gigafactory in Austin. The event will be live-streamed (and this being Tesla, timing has not been announced), though some institutional and retail investors will attend the event in person. Here are three big things to watch as the event unfolds: Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said his long-term goal for Tesla is to produce 20 million cars a year by 2030. With the company delivering 1.31 million vehicles in 2022, it has a long way to go to achieve that goal. The ramp-ups at Giga Austin, Giga Berlin, and expansion plans at Giga Shanghai will help, but the company would need more gigafactories than that to achieve such mass scale. As of the end of 2022, Tesla projected an installed annual capacity of around 1.9 million vehicles, and Musk has speculated Tesla will need 12 gigafactories in total to produce 20 million vehicles a year. Expect to hear more about these expansion plans on Wednesday — and a possible announcement on next steps. Government officials from Mexico to Indonesia have been talking to Tesla execs about expansion plans and would love nothing more than to bring Musk’s grand vision to their shores. A key part of the Investor Day will be the company’s reveal of its “generation 3 platform.” This generation 3 platform will likely be Tesla’s cheaper, robo-taxi car, as Musk has called it, and will be key to mass volume expansion of Tesla’s cars — and EVs globally in general. An EV costing around $25,000-$30,000 will open up a wide swath of potential customers looking for a cheap EV alternative. It’s most likely impossible for Tesla to deliver 20 million vehicles annually by 2030 without a cheaper EV to reach a mass group of buyers. Expect Tesla to show investors a working design or even a full-scale model of this gen-3 platform, and to hear a bit more about the platform underpinnings and powertrain. “While recent global price cuts have driven demand, TSLA likely needs Gen 3 to',\n",
       "  'Moody\\'s upgraded its outlook for Tesla bonds Monday, tagging them as a reliable investment. It\\'s the second ratings agency to lift the EV maker out of junk territory, following S&P in October. \"Tesla will maintain its position as one of the leading manufacturers of battery electric vehicles,\" Moody\\'s said. Moody\\'s Investors Service has upgraded Tesla bonds to investment-grade status for the first time, saying the Elon Musk-run carmaker\\'s dominance of the EV market and its efforts to keep costs low have boosted its ability to repay its debts. The agency, which judges companies\\' ability to pay back bondholders, lifted the company\\'s rating by one notch Monday. It now gives Tesla a \"Baa3\" rating, meaning it\\'s no longer labeling its bonds as \"junk\" or purely speculative —the outlook used for companies that might struggle to repay their debts. \"The rating action reflects Moody\\'s expectation that Tesla will remain one of the foremost manufacturers of battery electric vehicles with an expanding global presence and very high profitability,\" Rene Lipsch, senior credit officer at Moody\\'s, said in a ratings action note. \"The upgrade also incorporates governance considerations, including Tesla\\'s prudent financial policy and management\\'s operational track record,\" he added. Moody\\'s also cited Tesla planning to start production on its Cybertruck model later this year as one factor that contributed to its upgrade. Musk has set a goal of cutting the cost of building some Tesla models by 50%. Earlier in March, the CEO said there\\'s a clear path for Tesla to make a smaller EV at half the production cost and difficulty of its popular Model 3, per The Wall Street Journal.

       "  \"Tesla (TSLA) shares have been rallying well into 2023, and it’s for all the right reasons, at least for investors who took a bath last year. “Tesla is getting the right attention — you've seen the value come back into the stock that came out primarily because of Twitter,” said Craig Irwin of Roth Capital Partners in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Yes, Twitter. Though Tesla CEO (and current Twitter CEO) Elon Musk still has his hands tied with managing his latest purchase, Tesla bulls have been reassured lately that the company is back on the right path, following huge price cuts both here and abroad that have ginned up demand considerably for the pure-play EV-maker. Tesla is still the “category king” in EVs as Irwin calls it, and the fact that its 2022 production forecast slipped to 1.4 million from a forecast 1.5 million is still pretty impressive, all things considered. Despite competition ramping up, Tesla is essentially the only automaker to achieve volume production of EVs. But Irwin, who is overall bearish on Tesla, doesn’t see the recent good times lasting that long for shareholders. “We see Tesla as a great company, but we think there's going to be some [other] real winners. There are 100 or so EV models that are supposed to hit the road this year,” Irwin said. In addition to more competition coming from the likes of Ford, GM and Kia, another big area that Irwin sees as threatening Tesla’s generous multiple is margin compression. Irwin sees it coming down by a drastic factor as the company introduces lower priced vehicles like the upcoming Gen 3 vehicle and sees more price-conscious buyers coming in due to those price cuts. “So people that are buying on price cuts are not exactly prone to option things heavily, so you're mixing towards a lower-margin crowd of buyers with an already margin direct price cut,” Irwin said. “So I think we're probably looking towards more like 1,000 basis points in margin degradation over the next couple of quarters, instead of, basically, 500, 600, 700. That's heavy pressure.” In\",\n",

       "  'Tesla (TSLA) shares moved sharply lower Thursday following its Investor Day presentation the night before, at which the automaker addressed topics like CEO Elon Musk’s “Master Plan 3” and vehicle design but did not reveal a design or specifics about its “generation 3” upcoming car. “We will have a proper sort of product event, but it would be jumping the gun if we answer your questions [now],” Musk said in response to a question about the generation 3 car during a Q&A session last night. Though Musk and the Tesla team discussed AI, charging infrastructure, and supply chain improvements from Gigafactory Austin, the main disappointment was the lack of any concrete details on its next generation 3 car design, though it did reveal that two upcoming models will be joining the Tesla product portfolio, and its next gigafactory would be located in Monterey, Mexico. Tesla shares were down nearly 6% in Thursday\\'s session. “While Musk presented his ‘Master Plan Part 3’ intending to spark confidence and excitement about Tesla’s future, investors were underwhelmed … They were listening intently for more meat on the bones regarding Tesla’s concrete 2023 plans to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded and price-sensitive EV market,” said AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk in a note to clients. “Seven models from other automakers already are priced lower than Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, the company’s least expensive model, while even more EV automakers are racing aggressively into this space in 2023,” he said. The lack of specificity on that generation 3 car, expected to be Tesla’s cheapest offering at around $25K - $35K MSRP, is likely weighing on the stock, and on Wall Street analysts’ minds, as some are more bullish on the company long-term. \"Though Tesla\\'s plan to launch a $25K EV isn\\'t new, mass-market competitors will need their own roadmaps to profitably compete at those price-points in the coming few years,\" Citi\\'s Itay Michaeli said in a note to investors.

       "  \"Tesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this electric car maker have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share, indicating a change of -19.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.10 indicates a change of +32.6% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month,\",\n",

Moody’s Investor Research upgraded the EV-maker's credit rating to Baa3, which is the first rung on its investment grade ladder for corporate debt, with Tesla's credit outlook changed to stable. Previously Moody’s classified Tesla as Ba1, which is the agency’s top rating for high yield corporate, or junk, debt. In its report, Moody’s wrote the ratings upgrade “reflects Moody's expectation that Tesla will remain one of the foremost manufacturers of battery electric vehicles with an expanding global presence and very high profitability.” Moody’s expects Tesla to deliver around 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2023, which would be a 34% increase compared to 2022, and cites its “considerable investments” in new vehicle and battery production as enabling a “steep increase” in global deliveries. Moody’s noted that the expansion of the product lineup with the Cybertruck this year is a positive step. Moody’s also said that Tesla’s heightened focus on efficiencies in its manufacturing process—and financial prudence—were factors the upgrade. Moody’s expects Tesla to maintain an industry leading EBITA margin in the mid-high teens compared to its peers.

In upgrading Tesla to “BBB,” considered an investment grade rating, S&P analysts wrote at the time, “We believe Tesla continues to demonstrate market leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), with solid manufacturing efficiency that supports strong EBITDA margins and sustained positive free operating cash flow (FOCF), albeit with high capital expenditures.” With two ratings agencies giving Tesla investment grade debt ratings, Tesla is now considered a blue chip company from a corporate debt perspective.

Bitcoin is up almost 70% this year and 21% this month as small crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate and Signature were lost along with Silicon Valley Bank, and even mainstream banks like First Republic and Credit Suisse have been hit hard enough to require big rescues and in the latter\\'s case, a bargain basement buyout. Speaking to Bloomberg on March 21, Wood noted that \"one of the things that happens in a crisis is liquidity dries out so that that tends to hurt assets.\" But, she added: In a recent report, Ark recommended that institutional investors interested in digital assets should target 2.5% to 6.5% to Bitcoin, she said. \"So not crazy,\" Wood added. She said: In Ark\\'s Big Ideas 2023 report, the base case Bitcoin price prediction was $682,000 by 2030,\\xa0 while the bear case was more than $250,000 and the bull case nearly $1.5 million. Wood said the base case price, she believes, is \"quite conservative.\" Last week, Ark Invest revealed that it has raised $16 million for a new private crypto fund. Meanwhile, Wood, who has been buying swaths of Coinbase shares over the last few months, sold $13.5 million worth of COIN on March 21. That\\'s after Ark Invest bought about $30 million worth in February and another $30 million in the week of March 6. After its last buy, on March 10, Ark Invest owned 9.9 million shares of Coinbase. Wood has long been a strong supporter of Coinbase, despite its abysmal performance in 2022, when its share price declined 86%. That said, she did make some big sells last year, dumping 1.4 million in July alone, although she bought a lot later in the year. So what happened?

The Fed also on Sunday said it would increase the frequency it lends USD swaps to other central banks, an indication of increased demand for dollars. “Bitcoin is rallying as Wall Street becomes more aggressive in pricing Fed rate cuts and as banking sector worries drive some into alternative investments away from traditional financing,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for Oanda.

Bitcoin has risen 21% this month, while a choppy S&P 500 has lost 1.4% and gold has gained 8%. \"If you were going to describe an environment where there were successive bank runs because central banks are trying to fight inflation with fast rate increases, that is pretty close to as spot-on a thesis for owning bitcoin as you\\'ve ever heard,\" said Stéphane Ouellette, CEO at digital asset investment platform FRNT Financial. The cryptocurrency has, for now, severed its ties with stocks and bonds and tagged on to a rally in gold, fulfilling at least one part of creator Satoshi Nakamoto\\'s dream - that bitcoin can serve as a refuge for suffering investors. Bitcoin\\'s 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has slid to negative 0.12 over the past week, where a measure of 1 indicates the two assets are moving in lock step. A selloff in banks has wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars in market value and forced U.S. regulators to launch emergency measures.

Bitcoin’s revival has helped the digital-asset market add about $390 billion in value in 2023 after a $1.5 trillion rout last year.

Arbitrum: Network effects Guo Wengui: Hammer time From the Editor’s Desk Dear Reader, It’s not without a quiet sense of irony that we have been watching recent events unfold in the traditional banking sector. After a year in which the cryptocurrency industry has suffered unprecedented pain, it now seems to be TradFi’s turn, with the collapses of U.S. lenders Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to be followed by that of Credit Suisse, once a bastion of Big Finance and one of only 30 systemically important global lenders. The Swiss heavyweight’s problems triggered a worldwide banking market rout that has wiped around US$1 trillion off the value offinance sector shares in recent days. Nobody is suggesting for a moment that this makes the US$60 billion implosion of Terra or the US$8 billion hole that FTX’s crash left behind look small — and keep in mind that these sums were proportionally a much larger chunk of the crypto market than the latest share rout represents for TradFi. But it does put the 48% rise in crypto market cap over the past 14 days — particularly, perhaps, Bitcoin’s 71% gain since the beginning of the year — into perspective. So once again it has come to pass that a number of investors seem to be feeling at least as safe putting money into crypto as they do putting it into traditional banks. The crowing and “told you so” sneering by some in the TradFi space during crypto’s annus horribilis, in light of this, has the feel of rather ill-advised schadenfreude. We should emphasize that any such gloating among the crypto community would be equally ill-advised — not only given the industry’s woes of the past year but also the fact that turmoil in any part of the financial system, from Main Street banks to memecoins, heaps misery on investors large and (especially) small. Yet the irony remains. And with it persists one of the driving forces of the crypto phenomenon and the financial revolution that it has given the world. Crypto may have been down lately, but',\n",
